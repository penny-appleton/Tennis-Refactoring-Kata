Step 1 - get rid of long method
    -create method for ScoresEqual
    -create method for Advantage
    -create method for increment ScoreState

Step2 - get rid of switch statements
 - refactor to state pattern

States
    getPointValue() - returns static value
    setScore()
 ALL
 ADVANTAGE
 NORMAL

Static values
    LOVE
    Fifteen
    Thirty
    Forty

Step 3: refactor player into it's own class, Game doesn't need to hold onto player details it should just ask for them from the player


Updates for state pattern
create context class (Score) that interacts with State interface (ScoreState)
  -get context from Score class
  -won point should have Score class set score and update state;
  -getGameScore should call Score to get current score
